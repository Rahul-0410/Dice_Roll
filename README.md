Dice Roll Simulator

Welcome to the Dice Roll Simulator project! This project features a fun and interactive way to simulate rolling a dice. The final version of the project includes a dice at the center of the screen and a "Roll dice" button. When the button is clicked, it triggers an animation and generates a random number, which is displayed in the center of the dice. Additionally, the generated number is added to a history list.
